# WGU D502 Data Analytics Capstone: Aircraft Age and Accident Frequency

## Project Overview
This project investigates whether aircraft age correlates with accident frequency using publicly available data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  
The analysis evaluates whether aircraft aged 20 years or older have a significantly higher risk of reportable accidents compared to younger aircraft.

## Research Question
**Are aircraft aged 20 years or older more likely to be involved in reportable accidents than those under 20 years?**

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)
- Microsoft Access (for initial data extraction)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
